First of all our sincerest apologies for the small break of the Swiss League Project.
There were three major motifs to this downtime:

- Lack of time or dedication to other projects
- Changes on our server deployment
- Changes on the Lichess API

For the time being this issues have all been fixed.

One of the problems of our previous swiss tournaments were the AFK players after a reschedule.
To address this issues reschedules will remove all players.

With these change we hope to increase the number of legitimate swiss tournaments.

Thank you, and we look forward to seeing you in the next No Stop Swiss!

Welcome to the new website of the Swiss League!

We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who has participated in our No Stop Swiss Tournaments. The level of participation has far surpassed our expectations, and we anticipate reaching 1000 members in a few weeks, or perhaps even sooner!

Our website will serve as the primary source of information for users, while our Discord channel will be our primary method of communication.

We kindly request that you join our Discord channel and share your ideas for improving the Swiss League. We would greatly appreciate any suggestions for the upcoming 1000 member event.

Thank you, and we look forward to seeing you in the next No Stop Swiss!
